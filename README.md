### Hi, my name is RaphaÃ«l ðŸ‘‹

I always immerse in the discovery of IT/Coding. As you can see by browsing through my projects, JAVA, SPRING and back-end in general are my current preferences. But it's mostly because I havenâ€™t had the time to discover more for the moment. Kotlin, I'm watching you ! 

I want to participate to open-source projects about Linux. Right now, my only contribution is the French translation for this universal application store project under Linux. But since it's written in JavaScript, I don't know how long it will take before I learn enough JS to be able to propose features.

A daily user of Linux since recently (Lutris, proton, GLF, you have broken the last barrier, forever in my heart), Linux is very often my gateway to new interesting stuff.

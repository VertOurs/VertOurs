# Hi, my name is RaphaÃ«l ðŸ‘‹

I always immerse in the discovery of IT/Coding. As you can see by browsing through my projects, JAVA, SPRING and back-end in general are my current preferences. But it's mostly because I havenâ€™t had the time to discover more for the moment. Kotlin, I'm watching you ! :eyes:

I want to participate to open-source projects about Linux. Right now, my only contribution is the French translation for [this](https://app-outlet.github.io/) universal application store project under Linux. But since it's written in JavaScript, I don't know how long it will take before I learn enough JS to be able to propose features.

A daily user of Linux since recently (Lutris, proton, GLF, you have broken the last barrier, forever in my heart:two_hearts:), Linux is very often my gateway to new interesting stuff.

## My latest project

If you want to know how I code, look at [this](https://github.com/VertOurs/OC_P9_MediScreen) microservice project with docker and docker-compose. The pinned projects are good too ðŸ˜„.

## Plans

 * My priorities are toÂ :
    - Join a company where I can improve my knowledge of Java, Spring framework and algorithmic in general.
    - Be fluent in English as soon as possible.

 * Once I have more time for myself, I wish to create :
    - A Linux channel on YT for the general public and especially for those who are not well acquainted with computer science. 
    - Videos that I would have liked to find when I was learning computer development.
 
 By the way, Kotlin, I am still watching you ! :eyes: :eyes:


## ðŸ“« Contact me 
If you want to talk about all of this, please contact me at raphael.h.perrin@gmail.com. If you want to talk with me about beekeeping, permaculture, earthship building or even science fiction and fantasy, that's also a great reason to use this email.


## My latest discovery

[Nala](https://gitlab.com/volian/nala), is a front-end using `python-apt` api which does not show redundant messages, which formats the packages better, and uses color to show specifically what will happen with a package during install, removal, or an upgrade.

:smiling_face_with_three_hearts: I love it so much !!!! Have I told you that it supports parallel downloads unlike `apt`?
